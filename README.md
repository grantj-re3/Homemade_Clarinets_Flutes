# Homemade clarinets and flutes

This info is about homemade clarinets and flutes.
They are typically made from PVC pipe, but could be made from other
plastics, metal, bamboo, other types of wood, glass and even novelty
materials such as carrots, straws, paper and feather dusters!

## Clarinets

### Linsey Pollak

Australian instrument maker and musician.
- He provides measurements and other construction info
- Almost all info is free (or very cheap)
- Most of his materials are easily purchased in Australia

https://www.linseypollak.com/instruments/ discusses how to make a variety of wind instruments, including:
- [clarini](https://www.linseypollak.com/pdfs/clarini.pdf): see him playing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxxHgmZvk5c)
- carrot clarinet
- cylisax mk6 (cylindrical bore instrument which behaves like a saxophone in the upper register) made from polypipe ([video of similar instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Ka4M_CvVY))
- several flutes (see below)

He has also designed a serious wooden instrument for purchase, the Cylisax.

### Tuning

- [How to Tune a DIY PVC or Bamboo Flute - Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHYoks_xv_o&feature=youtu.be)

If all other things remain constant, the following will result in a sharper/higher pitch:

- Shortening the length of the pipe
- Narrowing the pipe bore
- Positioning the finger hole closer to the head (or mouthpiece or embouchure hole)
- Increasing the size/diameter of the finger hole
- Increasing the temperature of the pipe (by playing longer or blowing into the pipe)


### Calculators

#### PVC Pipe Flute Calculator

Online calculator:
http://www.anycalculator.com/pvcpipeflute.html

Features:

- any number of holes
- any scale/interval
- no need for hole diameters to be identical
- calculator plus extra building advice (e.g. cutoff frequency should
  be well above twice the target note if you wish to play the second octave)
- assumes you:
  * know the pipe length
  * know the embouchure hole position
  * know the plug position
  * can blow/play the pipe (without finger holes) to give the base note


#### Whistle Hole Calculator

Online calculator:
https://www.zahniser.net/physics05/MrZ/WhistleCalculator.html

Features:

- any number of holes
- assumes major scale
- assumes all hole diameters are identical
- calculator only (no extra building advice)
- assumes you:
  * know the pipe length
  * know the embouchure hole position
  * know the plug position
  * can blow/play the pipe (without finger holes) to give the base note

#### Tin Whistle Calculator (in Java; downloadable)

Downloadable Java app:

  * factors affecting the pitch of a note
  * tuning
  * effective length
  * cents
  * drilling
