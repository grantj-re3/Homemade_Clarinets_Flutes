# Homemade clarinets and flutes

This info is about homemade clarinets and flutes.
They are typically made from PVC pipe, but could be made from other
plastics, metal, bamboo, other types of wood, glass and even novelty
materials such as carrots, straws, paper and feather dusters!

There is a lot of great info about constructing homemade flutes
written by people in the USA. Although the principles hold true
anywhere, sourcing the PVC pipe (with US dimensions) can be
difficult for people like me
(in Australia). So some options include:
- instructions by Linsey Pollak (below) who sources PVC pipe or
  poly-pipe with Australian (often metric) dimensions
- adapting the dimensions of your flute (or clarinet?) using one
  of the calculators below

## Clarinet and saxophone-like instruments

### Linsey Pollak

Australian instrument maker and musician.
- He provides measurements and other construction info
- Almost all info is free (or very cheap)
- Most of his materials are easily purchased in Australia

https://www.linseypollak.com/instruments/ discusses how to make a variety of wind instruments, including:
- [clarini](https://www.linseypollak.com/pdfs/clarini.pdf): see him playing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxxHgmZvk5c) [*worked well for me*]
- carrot clarinet
- cylisax mk6 (cylindrical bore instrument which behaves like a saxophone in the upper register) made from polypipe ([video of similar instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Ka4M_CvVY))
- several flutes (see [Flute section](#flutes))

He has also designed a serious wooden instrument for purchase, the Cylisax.

## Tuning

- [Doug Tipple | Making a Simple Irish Flute](http://tippleflutes.com/making-a-simple-irish-flute/);
  for two octave tuning see the section starting with *Final Adjustments*
- Make and Tune PVC Pennywhistle Accurately in Two Octaves [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSvAKPJ2FmY); see 8m44s - 13m34s

- How to Tune a DIY PVC or Bamboo Flute - Part 2 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHYoks_xv_o&feature=youtu.be)

If all other things remain constant, the following will result in a sharper/higher pitch:

- Shortening the length of the pipe
- Narrowing the pipe bore
- Positioning the finger hole closer to the head (or mouthpiece or embouchure hole or blow hole)
- Increasing the size/diameter of the finger hole
- Increasing the area of the embouchure hole
- Increasing the temperature of the pipe (by playing longer or blowing into the pipe beforehand)

Other factors include:
- Pipe wall thickness
- Plug position?
- Position of other (open) finger holes
